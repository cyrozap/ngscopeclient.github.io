# Get Involved

Want to contribute to the project? We suggest joining the developer chat, which may be accessed via your choice of IRC or Discord (both channels are bridged so you can talk to everyone from either protocol).

* IRC webchat: [\#scopehal on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#scopehal) (or [connect with your own client](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/scopehal))
* Discord: [\#scopehal on 1bitsquared](https://discord.gg/URuN2BuGwG)

This is the primary mechanism for active developers to discuss features they're working on, help each other out, and coordinate the overall direction of the project.

We also host developer meetings on Zoom, typically about once per month. Connection and scheduling information is shared in the chat channel.
